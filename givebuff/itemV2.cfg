description = "Grant yourself and your party a buff.\nType in a buff template name (e.g. 'speed_boost_potion') and you'll get that buff, including the sound and screen effects.\nYou may optionally submit "true" as a second argument to apply the buff to the whole party.\nUsage: /givebuff <template> <apply to party?>\nFor a list of buffs, submit "list" as the template.\nIn this case, the second argument can be an absolute file path to save the list to.\nIf no path is given, the command will output to chat.\nE.G.: /givebuff list D:/cool_things/templates.txt;"
